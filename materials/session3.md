## Session 3

1. **Formulate a Research Question**: For example, "What are the current techniques being used to improve the efficiency of sorting algorithms in computer science?"¹².

2. **Develop a Protocol**: This includes defining the main research questions of the literature review, defining keywords, and defining the search string¹². For instance, the keywords could be "sorting algorithms", "efficiency", "computer science", and the search string could be "(sorting algorithms) AND (efficiency) AND (computer science)"².

3. **Search for Relevant Literature**: Use the search string to search for all relevant studies across multiple databases¹². For example, you could search databases like IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, etc².

4. **Screen the Literature**: Apply selection criteria to the studies found in the search to identify the most relevant ones¹². For example, you might only include studies published in the last five years, or only those that focus on a specific type of sorting algorithm¹².

5. **Assess the Quality of the Studies**: Evaluate the methodological quality of the selected studies¹². For instance, you might assess the validity of the results, the reliability of the data, the objectivity of the authors, etc¹².

6. **Extract the Data**: Extract and monitor the necessary data from the selected studies¹². For example, you might extract data on the specific techniques used, the results achieved, the limitations identified, etc¹².

7. **Synthesize the Data**: Analyze the results and synthesize the data from the selected studies¹². For instance, you might identify common themes, compare and contrast different techniques, identify gaps in the current research, etc¹².

8. **Write and Publish a Report**: Write a report detailing the findings of the review and publish it¹². For example, you might structure your report with an introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion sections¹².

Remember, these are just examples and the specific details may vary depending on the topic and scope of your review¹². Happy reviewing! 😊
