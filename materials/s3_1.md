# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Preparation

Preparation is the starting point of any SLR and is critical to the success of the review. It involves several key steps, including selecting the research question, defining the scope of the review, identifying relevant databases and search terms, and defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies.

i. **Selecting the Research Question**: The first step in preparation is selecting a clear and focused research question. This question should be relevant to the scholar's field of study and should guide the scope and direction of the review. The research question should be specific enough to allow for a comprehensive review, but broad enough to generate meaningful results.

| Step | Description                              | Example                                                    |
|------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identify the Research Area               | Computer Science, Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence |
| 2    | Determine the Research Purpose           | Answer a specific question, identify trends, compare and contrast different approaches |
| 3    | Identify the Research Gap                | Fill gaps in existing research, contribute new information or insights to the field |
| 4    | Formulate the Research Question          | "What are the most effective algorithms for image recognition in computer vision?" |
| 5    | Refine the Research Question             | "What are the most effective deep learning algorithms for image recognition in computer vision and how do they compare to traditional computer vision algorithms?" |

By following these steps, you can select a focused and relevant research question for your SLR in computer science.
