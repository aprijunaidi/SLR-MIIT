# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Preparation

Preparation is the starting point of any SLR and is critical to the success of the review. It involves several key steps, including selecting the research question, defining the scope of the review, identifying relevant databases and search terms, and defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies.

i. **Selecting the Research Question**: The first step in preparation is selecting a clear and focused research question. This question should be relevant to the scholar's field of study and should guide the scope and direction of the review. The research question should be specific enough to allow for a comprehensive review, but broad enough to generate meaningful results.

Steps for selecting the research question for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                              | Example                                                    |
|------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identify the Research Area               | Computer Science, Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence |
| 2    | Determine the Research Purpose           | Answer a specific question, identify trends, compare and contrast different approaches |
| 3    | Identify the Research Gap                | Fill gaps in existing research, contribute new information or insights to the field |
| 4    | Formulate the Research Question          | "What are the most effective algorithms for image recognition in computer vision?" |
| 5    | Refine the Research Question             | "What are the most effective deep learning algorithms for image recognition in computer vision and how do they compare to traditional computer vision algorithms?" |

By following these steps, you can select a focused and relevant research question for your SLR in computer science.

ii. **Defining the Scope of the Review**

Defining the scope of the review is the next stage after defining the research issue. This entails stating the length of time the review covered, the categories of studies it included, and the locations of those studies. For instance, the review's scope can cover papers with a specified study design, conducted in a particular nation or region, and published between 2000 and 2020.

Steps for defining the scope of a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                   | Example                                                   |
|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identify Keywords             | Image recognition, computer vision, algorithms, deep learning, computer graphics, artificial intelligence |
| 2    | Determine the Time Frame      | Latest 5 years, last 10 years, all time                    |
| 3    | Choose Relevant Databases     | [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp), [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/), [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) |
| 4    | Define Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria | Inclusion: Peer-reviewed journal articles, Exclusion: Books, conference papers |
| 5    | Specify the Language          | English only                                              |

By following these steps, you can define a clear and specific scope for your SLR, which will help to ensure that your results are relevant and meaningful.

iii. **Identifying Relevant Databases and Search Terms**

Finding the pertinent databases and search terms that will be utilized to find papers for the review is the next stage. Utilizing academic databases like Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science as well as additional sources like conference transcripts and grey literature may be necessary for this. To achieve a thorough search, the search phrases should be properly picked and pertinent to the research subject.

Steps for identifying relevant databases and search terms for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                           | Example                                                   |
|------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose Relevant Databases              | IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct           |
| 2    | Identify Keywords                     | Image recognition, computer vision, algorithms, deep learning, computer graphics, artificial intelligence |
| 3    | Use Boolean Operators                 | AND, OR, NOT                                              |
| 4    | Use Truncation and Wildcard Characters | *, ?, !                                                   |
| 5    | Refine the Search                      | Add synonyms, eliminate irrelevant results, add constraints (such as date, language) |

By following these steps, you can effectively search for relevant literature in your field, which will serve as the foundation for your SLR.
