# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Preparation

Preparation is the starting point of any SLR and is critical to the success of the review. It involves several key steps, including selecting the research question, defining the scope of the review, identifying relevant databases and search terms, and defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies.

i. **Selecting the Research Question**: The first step in preparation is selecting a clear and focused research question. This question should be relevant to the scholar's field of study and should guide the scope and direction of the review. The research question should be specific enough to allow for a comprehensive review, but broad enough to generate meaningful results.

Steps for selecting the research question for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                              | Example                                                    |
|------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identify the Research Area               | Computer Science, Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence |
| 2    | Determine the Research Purpose           | Answer a specific question, identify trends, compare and contrast different approaches |
| 3    | Identify the Research Gap                | Fill gaps in existing research, contribute new information or insights to the field |
| 4    | Formulate the Research Question          | "What are the most effective algorithms for image recognition in computer vision?" |
| 5    | Refine the Research Question             | "What are the most effective deep learning algorithms for image recognition in computer vision and how do they compare to traditional computer vision algorithms?" |

By following these steps, you can select a focused and relevant research question for your SLR in computer science.

ii. **Defining the Scope of the Review**

Defining the scope of the review is the next stage after defining the research issue. This entails stating the length of time the review covered, the categories of studies it included, and the locations of those studies. For instance, the review's scope can cover papers with a specified study design, conducted in a particular nation or region, and published between 2000 and 2020.

Steps for defining the scope of a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                   | Example                                                   |
|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identify Keywords             | Image recognition, computer vision, algorithms, deep learning, computer graphics, artificial intelligence |
| 2    | Determine the Time Frame      | Latest 5 years, last 10 years, all time                    |
| 3    | Choose Relevant Databases     | [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp), [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/), [Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/) |
| 4    | Define Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria | Inclusion: Peer-reviewed journal articles, Exclusion: Books, conference papers |
| 5    | Specify the Language          | English only                                              |

By following these steps, you can define a clear and specific scope for your SLR, which will help to ensure that your results are relevant and meaningful.

iii. **Identifying Relevant Databases and Search Terms**

Finding the pertinent databases and search terms that will be utilized to find papers for the review is the next stage. Utilizing academic databases like Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science as well as additional sources like conference transcripts and grey literature may be necessary for this. To achieve a thorough search, the search phrases should be properly picked and pertinent to the research subject.

Steps for identifying relevant databases and search terms for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                           | Example |
|------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose Relevant Databases              | IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct           |
| 2    | Identify Keywords                     | Image recognition, computer vision, algorithms, deep learning, computer graphics, artificial intelligence |
| 3    | Use Boolean Operators                 | AND, OR, NOT                                              |
| 4    | Use Truncation and Wildcard Characters | *, ?, !                                                   |
| 5    | Refine the Search                      | Add synonyms, eliminate irrelevant results, add constraints (such as date, language) |

By following these steps, you can effectively search for relevant literature in your field, which will serve as the foundation for your SLR.


## Defining the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Defining the inclusion and exclusion standards for the studies must then be established. Choosing things like the study population, publication date, and study design type may be necessary for this. Only high-quality studies should be included in the review, and the inclusion criteria should be stringent enough to achieve this while still being open-ended enough to allow for a thorough assessment of the literature.

Summarizing the steps for defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                           | Example |
|------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Determine the Purpose of the Review   | To evaluate the current state-of-the-art in deep learning for image recognition |
| 2    | Define the Scope of the Review         | Peer-reviewed journal articles, published in English, in the last 5 years |
| 3    | Establish Inclusion Criteria          | Must relate to deep learning for image recognition   |
| 4    | Establish Exclusion Criteria          | Conference papers, books, articles not related to image recognition |
| 5    | Evaluate the Relevance of Each Study   | Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, determine if the study should be included in the review |

By doing these actions, you can make sure that the studies you include in your SLR are pertinent to the review's goal and scope. This will aid in generating reliable and insightful results.

In summary, an SLR's preparation phase is essential to its success. Researchers can make sure that their SLR is well-defined, thorough, and relevant by following these crucial stages, and they can also make sure that they are able to make useful deductions about the existing state of knowledge in their area of interest.

## Searching for Studies

The next phase in performing an SLR is searching for research, which entails using the search terms and databases established during the preparation stage to find pertinent studies. This is commonly done by searching electronic databases, but it is also possible to search other sources like conference proceedings and grey literature.

Process of conducting an electronic database search as part of the Searching for Studies stage in an SLR

| Steps | Description                                         | Computer Science Example                                      |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.    | Use multiple databases                             | Use multiple databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library to search for relevant studies. |
| 2.    | Use search terms identified during the preparation stage | Use search terms such as “machine learning,” “computer vision,” and “deep learning” to locate relevant studies.    |
| 3.    | Refine searches using Boolean operators            | Use Boolean operators such as “AND” and “OR” to refine searches, for example: (“machine learning” AND “computer vision”) OR “deep learning.” |

This table provides an overview of the key steps involved in conducting an electronic database search as part of an SLR, using a computer science example. This process can help researchers to locate a large number of relevant studies on a given topic and is an important step in the overall SLR process.

**Screening the Studies**

Finding the studies and screening them for eligibility are the following steps. This entails comparing each study to the inclusion and exclusion standards established during the planning phase. Studies that don't fit the requirements for inclusion are taken out of the review, while those that do are kept in for additional examination.

Screening the Studies

|     | Study Title                                  | Inclusion Criteria                  | Exclusion Criteria                              | Eligibility |
|-----|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1   | "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare"      | Studies published in English        | Opinion pieces and non-research articles       | Included    |
| 2   | "Machine Learning Approaches for Predictive Maintenance" | Studies published in the past 10 years | Studies focused on other industries           | Included    |
| 3   | "Neural Networks in Image Processing"        | Studies using neural networks as the main approach | Studies using other techniques          | Included    |
| 4   | "The Impact of Deep Learning on Speech Recognition" | Studies evaluating the impact of deep learning | Studies that only compare deep learning to other techniques | Included    |
| 5   | "Applications of Reinforcement Learning in Robotics" | Studies applying reinforcement learning in robotics | Studies focused on other domains       | Included    |

Note: The above table is just an example, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria will vary depending on the specific research question and scope of the systematic literature review.

## Managing the Studies

**iii. Managing the Studies**: The research that is part of the review should be organized to make evaluation and retrieval simple. To do this, you might use a spreadsheet, a database, or reference management software.

Here's a hypothetical example of a table that could be used to manage the studies in a computer science-related systematic literature review:

Managing the Studies

| Study ID | Author(s)          | Year | Title                                                        | Method            | Participants/Samples | Results                                               |
|----------|--------------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Smith et al.        | 2020 | "Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Image Classification" | Comparative Study | 100                  | Algorithm X was found to have the highest accuracy for image classification |
| 2        | Johnson et al.      | 2021 | "A Study on Deep Learning Techniques for Speech Recognition"  | Experimental Study | 50                   | Technique Y showed significant improvement in speech recognition compared to traditional methods |
| 3        | Patel et al.        | 2022 | "Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Gaming Applications" | Comparative Study | 75                   | Approach Z was found to perform the best in terms of speed and accuracy for gaming applications |


This table provides a concise overview of the key information for each study, including the study ID, author(s), year, title, research method, number of participants/samples, and results. By organizing the studies in this manner, it becomes easier to assess the quality and relevance of each study, compare the results of different studies,

In conclusion, searching for studies is an important step in conducting an SLR. By using electronic database searches, screening the studies for eligibility, and managing the studies in an organized manner, researchers can ensure that they have located all relevant studies on their topic of interest and that they are ready to move on to the next stage of the SLR process.

## Appraising the Quality of the Studies

An important part of doing an SLR is assessing the caliber of the research, which entails assessing the caliber of each study that was included in the review. This phase helps to reduce the risk of deriving the wrong conclusions from low-quality studies and helps to guarantee that the review's findings are supported by high-quality studies.

**i. Determining Quality Criteria**: Choosing the quality standards to be applied is the first stage in evaluating the studies' level of quality. These guidelines should be based on acknowledged practices in the field and pertinent to the sort of study being conducted. For a randomized controlled trial, the appropriate sample size, the allocation concealment mechanism, and the blinding of participants and outcome assessors might all be considered as quality criteria.

Steps for determining quality criteria for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                         | Example                                              |
|------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose a Quality Assessment Tool    | Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale    |
| 2    | Define Quality Criteria              | Relevance, validity, reliability, generalizability, and objectivity |
| 3    | Assess Each Study                   | Evaluate the study based on the chosen quality assessment tool and the defined quality criteria |
| 4    | Record Results                      | Record the results of the quality assessment for each study in a consistent and systematic manner |
| 5    | Evaluate the Overall Quality of the Studies | Based on the quality assessment results, evaluate the overall quality of the studies included in the review |

By following these steps, you can ensure that the studies included in your SLR are of high quality, and that the results of the review are valid and trustworthy. This will help to increase the credibility and impact of your review.

**ii. Appraising the Studies**: The next stage is to evaluate each reviewed research in light of the quality standards. In order to do this, a conventional quality evaluation tool or a unique tool created especially for the review may be used. Each study's quality should be systematically recorded, and the final report should contain a summary of the quality findings.

Summarizing the steps for appraising the studies for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                      | Example                                              |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose an Appraisal Tool         | CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) or AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) |
| 2    | Define Appraisal Criteria         | Relevance, validity, reliability, generalizability, and objectivity |
| 3    | Appraise Each Study               | Evaluate each study based on the chosen appraisal tool and the defined appraisal criteria |
