# Zotero

Zotero is a powerful tool that can greatly facilitate the process of creating systematic literature review articles. Here's how you can use Zotero for this purpose:

1. **Collecting Sources**: Zotero can be used in conjunction with the Zotero Connector to gather relevant materials being researched, such as websites, academic sources, or technical briefs¬≤. You can upload multiple citations at one time from PubMed to Zotero for your systematic review¬π.

2. **Organizing Materials**: Zotero collections or folders are a useful tool for organizing materials pertaining to a single research project. It is advised to organize all materials into a folder that can later be organized into a literature review for a specific research assignment¬≤.

3. **Annotating Items**: Zotero has the ability to create notes for each reference as you collect and organize them. We will use this function to annotate for every source being tracked. To create a note, select an entry of your library and switch to the "notes" tab. These should contain useful information for your research¬≤.

4. **Creating a Literature Review**: Once you've created notes for a list of items in Zotero, you can export them to create your literature review¬≤.

5. **Collaboration**: Zotero also allows for easy collaboration, making it ideal for team projects. You can share your library with others and work together on the same project¬≤.

Remember, the key to a successful literature review is a systematic and organized approach, and Zotero provides the tools to do just that¬≤. Happy researching! üòä
